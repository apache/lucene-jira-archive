Bits 1 & 2:
On 64 bits and 32 bits os
- Byte level is better

Bits 3:
On 64 bits
- Integer level is better (10 Kints)
On 32 bits:
- not noticeable difference

Bits 4:
On 64 bits:
- Byte Level & Integer level is better (Integer better than original FOR on 512 size block - ~10Kints, similar to original FOR on 2048 size block, Byte level better on 2048 block size - ~ 5 Kints)
On 32 bits:
- Byte level is better (10Kints on 256 block size, 5Kints on 2048 block size)

Bits 5:
On 64 Bits:
- Integer level is better (similar to original FOR on 2048 size block)
On 32 Bits:
- Byte level is better (10Kints on 512 block size, 5Kints on 2048 block size)

Bits 6:
On 64 bits:
- Byte level (but very similar to original FOR)
On 32 Bits:
- Byte level (~5Kints)

Bits 7:
On 64 bits:
- Original FOR with IntBuffer
On 32 bits:
- byte level (~5Kints on 512, 10Kins on 2048)

Bits 8:
On 64 bits:
- Byte level is better (~10 KInts)
On 32 bits:
- byte level (~5Kints on 512, 10Kins on 2048)

Bits 9 - 15:
On 64 bits:
- Original with IntBuffer is better. More the number of bits is increasing (and more the block is large), more we can notice a difference the difference. In some cases the difference is quite notable, between 10 to 15 KInts.
On 32 bits:
- Integer level and original FOR performs similarly

Bits 16:
On 64 bits:
- Byte level is similar to Original FOR with IntBuffer.
On 32 bits:
- byte level or integer level (~5Kints on 2048 block size compared to original FOR with IntBuffer)
