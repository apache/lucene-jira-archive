+ *
+ *      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,

+ *      source, and configuration files.
+ *
+ *      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
+ *      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
+ *      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

+ *
+ *      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
+ *      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
+ *      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
+ *      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
+ *
+ *      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
+ *      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
+ *      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
+ *      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
+ *      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
+ *      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
+ *      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
+ *
+ *      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
+ *      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
+ *      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
+ *      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner

+ *      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

+ *   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+ *      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+ *      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+ *      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
+ *      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
+ *      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
+ *
+ *   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+ *      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

+ *      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
+ *      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

+ *      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
+ *      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
+ *      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
+ *      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
+ *      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
+ *      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
+ *      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
+ *      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
+ *      as of the date such litigation is filed.
+ *
+ *   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
+ *      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
+ *      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
+ *      meet the following conditions:
+ *
+ *      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
+ *          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
+ *
+ *      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
+ *          stating that You changed the files; and
+ *
+ *      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
+ *          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
+ *          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+ *          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+ *          the Derivative Works; and
+ *
+ *      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+ *          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+ *          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+ *          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+ *          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+ *          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+ *          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+ *          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+ *          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+ *          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+ *          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+ *          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+ *          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+ *          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+ *          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+ *          as modifying the License.
+ *
+ *      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+ *      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+ *      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+ *      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+ *      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+ *      the conditions stated in this License.
+ *
+ *   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+ *      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+ *      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+ *      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+ *      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+ *      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+ *      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+ *
+ *   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+ *      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+ *      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+ *      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+ *
+ *   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+ *      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+ *      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+ *      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+ *      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+ *      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+ *      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+ *      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+ *      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+ *
+ *   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+ *      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+ *      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+ *      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+ *      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+ *      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+ *      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+ *      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+ *      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+ *      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+ *      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+ *
+ *   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+ *      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+ *      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+ *      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+ *      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+ *      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+ *      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+ *      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+ *      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+ *      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
+ *
+ *   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+ *
+ *   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
+ *
+ *      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
+ *      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"

+ *      source, and configuration files.
+ *
+ *      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
+ *      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
+ *      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

+ *
+ *      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
+ *      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
+ *      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
+ *      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
+ *
+ *      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
+ *      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
+ *      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
+ *      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
+ *      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
+ *      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
+ *      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
+ *
+ *      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
+ *      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
+ *      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
+ *      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner

+ *      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

+ *
+ *      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
+ *      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
+ *      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
+ *
+ *   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+ *      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+ *      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+ *      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
+ *      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
+ *      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
+ *
+ *   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+ *      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+ *      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+ *      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
+ *      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
+ *      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
+ *      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
+ *      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
+ *      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
+ *      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
+ *      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
+ *      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
+ *      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
+ *      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
+ *      as of the date such litigation is filed.
+ *
+ *   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
+ *      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
+ *      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
+ *      meet the following conditions:
+ *
+ *      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
+ *          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
+ *
+ *      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
+ *          stating that You changed the files; and
+ *
+ *      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
+ *          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
+ *          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+ *          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+ *          the Derivative Works; and
+ *
+ *      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+ *          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+ *          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+ *          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+ *          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+ *          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+ *          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+ *          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+ *          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+ *          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+ *          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+ *          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+ *          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+ *          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+ *          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+ *          as modifying the License.
+ *
+ *      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+ *      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+ *      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+ *      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+ *      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+ *      the conditions stated in this License.
+ *
+ *   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+ *      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+ *      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+ *      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+ *      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+ *      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+ *      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+ *
+ *   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+ *      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+ *      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+ *      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+ *
+ *   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+ *      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+ *      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+ *      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+ *      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+ *      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+ *      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+ *      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+ *      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+ *
+ *   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+ *      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+ *      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+ *      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+ *      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+ *      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+ *      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+ *      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+ *      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+ *      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+ *      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+ *
+ *   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+ *      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+ *      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+ *      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+ *      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+ *      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+ *      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+ *      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+ *      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+ *      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
+ *
+ *   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+ *
+ *   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
+ *
+ *      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
+ *      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
+ *      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
+ *      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate

+ *      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
+ *      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
+ *      identification within third-party archives.

+This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this license can

+is the same as the previous version and is written so as to preserve the Free
+Software Foundation's assessment of GPL compatibility and OSI's certification
