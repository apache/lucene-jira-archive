 /**
- * A filter that replaces accented characters in the ISO Latin 1 character set 
- * (ISO-8859-1) by their unaccented equivalent. The case will not be altered.
+ * A filter that replaces non-ASCII characters in the ISO Latin 1 character set 
+ * (ISO-8859-1) with ASCII characters. The replacement is done without considering
+ * semantic character equivalence. The case will not be altered.
+ * 
  * <p>
  * For instance, '&agrave;' will be replaced by 'a'.
  * <p>
+ * 
+ * <p>
+ * The purpose of this class is to allow users easy entry with a keyboard of another language.
+ * It should not be used when search accuracy is considered to be more important than ease of
+ * entry with a another type of keyboard.
+ * </p>
+ * 
+ * <p>
+ * <b>
+ * Please note that the replacements performed by this filter will result in words changing their original semantic meaning in many cases.<br>
+ * It will also be impossible to search for the word in its original form.
