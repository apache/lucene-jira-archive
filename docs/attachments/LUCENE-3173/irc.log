<ndavid> how? I thought we could leave Scorers out of this
<rmuir> not Scorer DocScorer :)
<rmuir> the one your Sim makes
<rmuir> we can give that a better name too
<rmuir> maybe rename Scorer to Matcher
<rmuir> and make the one in Similarity Scorer
<ndavid> hm
<ndavid> actually that makes sense
<rmuir> yeah i think so too
<rmuir> you want to open a jira issue? we can propose this
<ndavid> ok
<ndavid> let me add it to my "issues" list
<rmuir> i think if we are separating scoring from the postings-matching we should fix the naming too :)
<ndavid> computeStats?
<ndavid> computeStatistics?
<rmuir> thats an idea
<ndavid> computeThingy doesn't sound scientific enough :)
<rmuir> right, i like computeWeight -> computeStats
