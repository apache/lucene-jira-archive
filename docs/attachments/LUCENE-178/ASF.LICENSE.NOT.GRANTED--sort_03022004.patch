  * <p><h3>Memory Usage</h3>

- * See {@link FieldSortedHitQueue FieldSortedHitQueue} for
- * information on the memory requirements of sorting hits.
+ * <p>Sorting uses of caches of term values maintained by the
+ * internal HitQueue(s).  The cache is static and contains an integer
+ * or float array of length <code>IndexReader.maxDoc()</code> for each field
+ * name for which a sort is performed.  In other words, the size of the
+ * cache in bytes is:
+ *
+ * <p><code>4 * IndexReader.maxDoc() * (# of different fields actually used to sort)</code>
+ *
+ * <p>For String fields, the cache is larger: in addition to the
+ * above array, the value of every term in the field is kept in memory.
+ * If there are many unique terms in the field, this could
+ * be quite large.
+ *
+ * <p>Note that the size of the cache is not affected by how many
+ * fields are in the index and <i>might</i> be used to sort - only by
+ * the ones actually used to sort a result set.
+ *
+ * <p>The cache is cleared each time a new <code>IndexReader</code> is
+ * passed in, or if the value returned by <code>maxDoc()</code>
+ * changes for the current IndexReader.  This class is not set up to
+ * be able to efficiently sort hits from more than one index
+ * simultaneously.
