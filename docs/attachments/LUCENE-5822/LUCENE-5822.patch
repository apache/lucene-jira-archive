+# Apache Lucene and Solr
+
+Apache Lucene is a high-performance, full featured text search engine library
+written in Java.
+
+Apache Solr is an enterprise search platform written using Apache Lucene.
+Major features include full-text search, index replication and sharding, and
+result faceting and highlighting.
+
+## Online Documentation
+
+This README file only contains basic setup instructions.  For more
+comprehensive documentation, visit:
+
+- Lucene: <http://lucene.apache.org/core/documentation.html>
+- Solr: <http://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/>
+
+## Building Lucene/Solr
+
+(You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.)
+
+Lucene and Solr are built using [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/).  To build
+Lucene and Solr, run:
+
+`ant compile`
+
+The Solr server can then be packaged and prepared for startup by running the
+following command from the `solr/` directory:
+
+`ant server`
+
+## Running Solr
+
+After [building Solr](#building-lucene-solr), the server can be started using
+the `bin/solr` control scripts.  Solr can be run in either standalone or
+distributed (SolrCloud mode).
+
+To run Solr in standalone mode, run the following command from the `solr/`
+directory:
+
+`bin/solr start`
+
+To run Solr in SolrCloud mode, run the following command from the `solr/`
+directory:
+
+`bin/solr start -c`
+
+The `bin/solr` control script allows heavy modification of the started Solr.
+Common options are described in some detail in solr/README.txt.  For an
+exhaustive treatment of options, run `bin/solr start -h` from the `solr/`
+directory.
+
+## Development/IDEs
+
+Ant can be used to generate project files compatible with most common IDEs.
+Run the ant command corresponding to your IDE of choice before attempting to
+import Lucene/Solr.
+
+- *Eclipse* - `ant eclipse`
+- *IntelliJ* - `ant idea`
+- *Netbeans* - `ant netbeans`
+
+## Running Tests
+
+The standard test suite can be run with the command:
+
+`ant test`
+
+Like Solr itself, the test-running can be customized or tailored in a number or
+ways.  For an exhaustive discussion of the options available, run:
+
+`ant test-help`
