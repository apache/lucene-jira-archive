S5: audit every issue in the CSV file from S1 above to determine if/when the issue should get fixVersion="master (7.0)" added to it or fixVersion="6.0" removed from it:

- if it only ever had commits to master (ie: before branch_6x was made on March 2nd) then no action needed.
- if it has distinct commits to both master after branch_6x was made on March 2nd, then fixVersion="master (7.0)" should definitely be added.
- if it has no commits to branch_6_0, and the only commits to branch_6x are after branch_6_0 was created on March 3rd, then fixVersion="6.0" should be removed.
- if there are no obvious commits in the issue comments, then sanity check why it has any fixVersion at all (can't reproduce? dup? etc...)

NOTE: 6.0 tag SHA dated: Thu, 7 Apr 2016 07:46:04 -0700
